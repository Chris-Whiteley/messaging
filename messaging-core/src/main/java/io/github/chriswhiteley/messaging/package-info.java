/**
 * Provides interfaces and classes for implementing common messaging patterns,
 * such as Producer-Consumer, Publisher-Subscriber, Request-Reply, and more.
 *
 * <p>The library is designed to offer a flexible and reusable framework for
 * message-driven systems, supporting generic types and timeout handling for
 * advanced use cases.</p>
 *
 * <p>Example patterns include:</p>
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Producer-Consumer</li>
 *     <li>Publisher-Subscriber</li>
 *     <li>Request-Reply</li>
 *     <li>Message Queue</li>
 *     <li>Stream Processing</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>This library aims to simplify messaging workflows across local and distributed systems.</p>
